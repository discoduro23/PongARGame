# PongARGame (University Project)
 Pong AR Game using Vuforia engine for university proyect.

The AR cards used on this project as the targets are the following samples: 'astronaut' (for the center of the world) and the 'drone' (for the moving card, used as the player bar).
You can download the images in the [Vuforia Web](https://library.vuforia.com/sites/default/files/vuforia-library/docs/target_samples/unity/mars_target_images.pdf)

Note: You need to import the Vuforia Package due to github restrictions. The file 'com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.7.2' need to be moved to 'Packages/'.
